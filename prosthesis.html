  <h2>II.i Prosthesis and Physical Function</h2>
  <p>Prosthetic devices play a critical role in restoring physical functionality for individuals who have experienced limb loss. They are designed to replace missing or damaged body parts, with the goal of improving mobility, independence, and overall quality of life. Prostheses can be categorized into upper and lower limb prostheses, each serving distinct functions depending on the level of amputation and the user's specific needs.</p>
  <p>Upper-limb prostheses are primarily designed to restore functions such as grasping, holding, and manipulating objects. These devices vary in complexity and function. Passive prostheses are cosmetic and do not facilitate movement, but they can help with stabilization and performing light activities. More advanced options include body-powered prostheses, which are operated through cables and harnesses that use the user’s remaining muscle movements to control the prosthetic. While these devices are reliable and durable, they require upper-body strength and offer limited dexterity. A more sophisticated option is the myoelectric prosthesis, which uses electrical signals from the user’s muscles to control the prosthetic's movements, allowing for more natural and precise actions, such as opening and closing the hand. Hybrid prostheses combine features of both body-powered and myoelectric systems to provide a balance of functionality and dexterity, giving users more flexibility.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, lower-limb prostheses are designed to restore mobility and balance for individuals with lower limb amputation. These devices are categorized based on the level of amputation, such as transfemoral prosthesis (above-knee) and transtibial prostheses (below-knee). Transfemoral prosthesis typically incorporate knee and hip components to facilitate movement and stability during walking, while transtibial prostheses focus on restoring the functions of the lower leg and foot. The lower-limb prosthesis works by redistributing the user’s weight and supporting a natural gait cycle. More advanced models, such as microprocessor-controlled prostheses, use sensors to adjust knee and ankle movements in real-time, adapting to different walking speeds, terrain, and conditions.</p>

  <h2>II.ii Mental Health in Amputees</h2>
  <p>The psychological journey of amputees is deeply complex, influenced by a range of emotional reactions stemming from the trauma of limb loss. Amputation frequently triggers an array of psychological issues, such as grief, identity crises, body image disturbances, and feelings of social stigma. Early emotional responses typically include denial, frustration, anxiety, and depression, significantly affecting the individual’s overall mental health (Murray 2009, 26-28).</p>
  <p>Studies suggest that amputees who face difficulties in mental adjustment experience delays or challenges in adapting effectively to prosthetics, underscoring the importance of psychological well-being as part of rehabilitation (Matos, Naves, and Araujo 2020). Furthermore, mental health professionals play a crucial role in normalizing these emotional responses and guiding amputees towards effective coping strategies (Marini et al. 2021). Addressing mental health early in the adaptation process substantially enhances the psychological resilience and long-term adjustment of amputees.</p>
