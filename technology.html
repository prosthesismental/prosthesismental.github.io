  <h2>V Advancements in Prosthetic Technology and Mental Health</h2>

  <h3>V.i Technological Advancements in Prosthetics</h3>
  <p>Recent technological innovations have dramatically reshaped the landscape of prosthetic devices, offering enhanced functionality and improved quality of life. Breakthroughs include sophisticated bionic limbs, neural interface technologies, AI integration, and 3D printing, all aimed at closely replicating natural limb function (Cordella et al. 2020). Smart prosthetics employing EEG and fNIRS technologies now allow more intuitive limb control, reducing cognitive load and enhancing adaptation (Zhang et al. 2024).</p>

  <h3>V.ii Psychological Impact of Technological Advancements</h3>
  <p>Advancements in prosthetic technology have profound psychological implications, influencing both positive outcomes and new challenges. Advanced prosthetics, such as myoelectric limbs and neural-controlled devices, significantly boost users' self-esteem and body image by closely replicating natural limb function and appearance (Cordella et al. 2020). However, these complex systems can sometimes create psychological stress related to the challenges of mastering advanced technologies or coping with the high expectations these devices entail (Marini et al. 2021).</p>

  <h3>V.iv The Future of Prosthetics and Psychological Well-being</h3>
  <p>The ongoing evolution in prosthetic technology promises significant psychological benefits for amputees. Emerging technologies such as advanced neuroprosthetics, real-time adaptive systems, and personalized prosthetics tailored by AI present unprecedented opportunities for improving amputees' quality of life (Zhang et al. 2024). Future developments emphasize seamless integration with the human nervous system, potentially minimizing cognitive and psychological burdens associated with current adaptation processes.</p>

  <h3>V.v The Intersection of Technology and Mental Health</h3>
  <p>The evolving intersection between prosthetic technology and mental health presents promising yet complex implications for amputees. As technological innovations advance, their impact extends beyond physical rehabilitation, significantly influencing psychological adaptation processes (Cordella et al. 2020). Proper integration of psychological support within technological frameworks can substantially enhance amputees' well-being, whereas lack of mental health consideration may exacerbate psychological distress.</p>
